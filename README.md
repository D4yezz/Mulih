Mulih 🏡 – My Journey Learning React.js

Mulih is a personal project I developed to deepen my understanding of React.js. It’s more than just a website — it’s a space where I practice writing clean components, applying modern design systems, and exploring animation with Framer Motion.

I also integrated shadcn/ui to create sleek, accessible UI components with Tailwind CSS. This project represents my growth as a front-end developer, with hands-on experience in building real, responsive interfaces.

Whether you're a fellow learner, recruiter, or just curious, feel free to explore the code and see how I bring ideas to life using React.

💡 Built with curiosity, code, and a lot of caffeine.

🛠️ Tech Stack: React.js • Tailwind CSS • Vite • Framer Motion • shadcn/ui

⚙️ Status: Actively learning & improving!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
